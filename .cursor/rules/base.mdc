# Project Rules
This is a Laravel app with React (Inertia) on the frontend.

## Testing
- Always use `#[Test]` attribute syntax for tests
- Never add comments above tests - test names should be descriptive
- If asked to write a test, produce a failing test before implementing (TDD approach)
  - It's important to first see a failing test, otherwise it defeats the purpose

## Development workflow
- Never offer to run `npm run dev` or `php artisan serve` - I run those commands in my own shell
- Always use `artisan make` to generate files whenever possible
  - For basic classes, use `artisan make:class`
  - Never generate a file manually that Laravel can generate automatically
